![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/447e46b1-d417-4eff-a2f4-5b43bb3a8115)

**Capsule** is a creative time travel journal app where users can write journal entries, "send" them into the future, and view them once they "return." Designed with a cosmic theme, the app encourages users to reflect on their thoughts and experiences, sending them off to be rediscovered at a later date.

## Features

- **Write New Entries:** Compose entries with a specific return date in the future.
- **Send to Space:** Choose preset time intervals (e.g., 1 week, 1 month, or 1 year) or select a custom date for the entry to return.
- **View Returned Entries:** Once the specified date arrives, entries become available in the "View Entries" section.
- **Visual Cosmic Theme:** A starry night background and gradient colors add to the "time travel" experience.
- **Real-Time Timer:** Shows the time elapsed since the last entry was launched.
